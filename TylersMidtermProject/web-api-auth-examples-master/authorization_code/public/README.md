Starting this assigment, I realized I didn't know the best way to insert data returned from an API directly into an HTML file. While taking this class
I am reading the book "JavaScript and JQuery" by Jon Duckett. In the book, it showed how to edit the DOM with JavaScript, so I elected to do this using
the innerHTML property. I also used css examples from the book to create this page. I attempted to get rid of all the css code I didn't understand and changed the code I did understand. 

The other learning curve for this week was figuring out how to get data from an API. I used Open Weather Map to get the data I used on this page utilizing a call to their API directly in the browser's search bar. I am excited to learn how to more efficiently access and utilize data from APIs soon.

This assignment, I also was confused as to what the easiest way to attach my js code to my HTML. Last week I had success with innterHTML so I used it again. Although it took me a little while to grasp the syntax of js in this context, I found the assignment to be fairly painless. On the other hand, this week I reached the AJAX and JSON chapter of my textbook. This was the first point in the book where I began to feel a little bit lost. I think I conceptually understand what is going on, but I am very excited to see some practical examples in class.
